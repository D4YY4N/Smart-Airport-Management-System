# Semester Project: Smart Airport Management System

## Introduction

Efficient airport operations are crucial for passenger satisfaction and maximizing resource utilization. However, modern airports face numerous challenges, including inefficient navigation systems, scheduling conflicts, and the inability to adapt dynamically to unforeseen circumstances. These issues lead to delays, overcrowding, and resource wastage, ultimately impacting the overall efficiency of airport management. Our project, "Smart Airport Management System," aims to tackle these challenges through the implementation of efficient data structures and algorithms.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the pressing need for improved navigation and scheduling solutions in airport management. Existing systems often struggle to provide real-time updates, handle large datasets efficiently, or adapt to dynamic changes. By focusing on these challenges, our project contributes to enhancing operational efficiency and passenger experience.

## Objectives

* Develop a scalable and efficient system for managing airport navigation and flight scheduling.
* Utilize advanced data structures to optimize search, insertion, and update operations.

    * Chosen for managing flight scheduling due to their logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
    * Ensured efficient organization and retrieval of flight data based on attributes such as time, destination, and flight number.

* **Linked Lists:**
    * Used for handling dynamic passenger and flight information, enabling seamless addition, removal, and updates.
    * Provided flexibility in data management, crucial for real-time operations.

### Implementation

The implementation process was carefully planned and executed in the following phases:

* **System Design:**
    * Conceptualized the system architecture, emphasizing modularity and scalability.
    * Defined the scope of functionalities, including navigation and scheduling features.

* **Development:**
    * Implemented BST for scheduling functionalities to manage and organize flight data effectively.
    * Utilized linked lists for dynamic operations, allowing flexible data handling.
    * Designed intuitive user input and output interfaces to streamline interaction.

* **Testing and Optimization:**
    * Conducted thorough unit testing to validate each module's functionality.
    * Evaluated overall system performance under simulated real-world scenarios.
    * Optimized algorithms for enhanced execution speed and efficient memory usage.

### Tools Used

* **Programming Language:** C++ with STL for foundational operations.
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 and CLion 2024.2.2 for development and debugging.
* **Testing Frameworks:** Custom test cases designed to simulate real-world scenarios and validate system accuracy.

This systematic methodology ensured the development of a robust, efficient, and user-friendly system capable of addressing the primary challenges in airport management.

## Performance Metrics

### Time Complexity Analysis

Our airport management system utilizes Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree, connecting airports with the least total distance.

**Key Operations:**

* **Edge Addition:** O(1) per edge, resulting in O(V^2) for all edges.
* **Prim's Algorithm:** O(V^2) due to the repeated search for the minimum key and edge weight updates.
* **Graph Display:** O(V^2) to print the adjacency matrix representation.

The time complexity of the system is dominated by Prim's algorithm and graph display, resulting in O(V^2), where V is the number of airports.

### Memory Usage

Optimized memory utilization through dynamic allocation.

## Discussion

The results of our project demonstrate significant progress in tackling the challenges of airport navigation and flight scheduling. The Binary Search Tree proved invaluable for scheduling tasks, providing efficient data organization and quick retrieval times. Linked lists added flexibility and adaptability, ensuring real-time updates and seamless handling of dynamic data.

The project’s strengths include its efficient scheduling and navigation functionalities, modular design enabling scalability and easy maintenance, and the ability to provide real-time data updates for practical use in dynamic scenarios. However, challenges faced during development include limited development time, which restricted the scope of features implemented, debugging complexities due to module interdependencies, and difficulty in simulating real-world data due to resource constraints.

## Limitations

* The current system lacks integration with real-time external data sources, limiting its adaptability to live scenarios.
* Absence of machine learning models for predictive analysis and decision-making.
* User interface design is basic and lacks advanced visualization features.

## Future Work

* Expand the scope to include comprehensive airport management features, such as resource allocation and passenger tracking.
* Integrate machine learning models for predictive scheduling and navigation optimization.
* Develop a more sophisticated user interface with advanced visualizations.
* Incorporate live data feeds for real-time operations.
